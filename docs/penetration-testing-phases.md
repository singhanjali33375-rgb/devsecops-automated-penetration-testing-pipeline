# Penetration Testing Phases

## 1. Reconnaissance
Asset discovery and technology fingerprinting using automated tools.

## 2. Scanning
Identification of open ports, services, and known vulnerabilities.

## 3. Enumeration
Deep inspection of APIs, application endpoints, and configurations.

## 4. Exploitation (Simulated)
Mapping vulnerabilities to potential attack paths using threat models.

## 5. Post-Exploitation
Impact analysis, reporting, and security hardening recommendations.
